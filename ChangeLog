1.0 initial release as TutorEm

1.2 initial release as Tutti II
    port to OS X
    initial tape support with traps and OS integration
    fix colour bug in hi-res mode
    hacks for sprites
    improve performance by skipping frames with no changes
    clean up 9995 timing loop

1.5 second Tutti II release
    support for paste as keystrokes
    AltiVec acceleration (G4/G5) for 9918 emulation
    2x display (with AltiVec scaling on G4/G5)
    multiple fixes to the 9995 core
    display list 9918 sprite algorithm is now scanline correct
    fix crash in tape save dialogue
    faster writes to mmapped i/o
    enabled _/@ key (mapped to backquote key)
    additional alternate MOD key for keyboard without Right-Opt (iBook G4, etc)
	to numeric keyboard ENTER
    you can use both shift keys now (both map to "SHIFT")
    further improvements to timing loop
    debugger can emit instruction stream to stdout (toggled with F7)
    Command-M actually does minimize the window now
    9995 STWP instruction correctly disassembled
    fix visual glitch with "2" glyph in debugger

2.0 third Tutti II release ("Tutti Two Two Meets The Hooded Fang")
    This version introduces dramatically improved emulation and fixes a lot of
    bugs, including BASIC SOUND ERR 2, crashes, and errors with tape output.

    source code refactor to make system more modular and implement debugging
    custom SN76489AN sound emulation, including noise channel
    massively overhauled 9995 emulation with ALU core modified from MAME/MESS
        (this fixed a lot of bugs just by itself!)
    9918ANL palette recalibrated
    numeric keypad keys "84560." emulate joystick (0 and . are SL/SR)
    9995 decremeter actually works to spec using a custom algorithm
    9995 decrementer IRQ 3 now independent of VDP sync (as on a real system)
    ... so the menu option is now "Sync IRQ3 to System Clock"
    timing loop recalibrated against a real Tutor
    screen updates are even faster
    screen updates are less frequent to improve performance/reduce tearing
    stuck final sync bits are now flushed, fixing issues with real machine LOAD
    illegal instructions hit 9995 debugger (this includes the BASIC COLOR bug)
    sprites scrolling under top border no longer display garbage
    potential crash in sprite subsystem wallpapered
    lots of old code removed

2.2 fourth Tutti II release ("Tutti Two Point Two Meets The Hooded Fang")
    This version introduces the 64-bit macOS and 32-bit Windows versions,
    ironically porting Tutti back to the platform it started from (as
    TutorEm), and makes other portability updates for future ports.

    working Win32 port (compatible with Wine and Windows 98 on up)
	(crossbuilt with mxe: if you make a Visual Studio version, PR me)
    working macOS x86_64 port for 10.12+ because Apple wants to make the Mac
	completely irrelevant by making it incompatible with older existing
	32-bit software but I don't care because I'm going Linux eat me Tim
    ... btw, the existing 32-bit Universal 10.4-10.13 build is still supported
    paste as keystrokes now can be aborted (Command-V or Ctrl-V during paste)
    debugger now can show the screen (S to toggle)
    64-bit fixes
    fix issue where decrementer routine dropped clock pulses
    fix issue where paste as keystrokes could munge the keyboard state
    many compiler warnings cleaned up
    more old code removed
